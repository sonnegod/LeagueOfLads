# Scripts

Utility and scheduled-job scripts live here to keep the project root focused on
app entrypoints and shared modules.

- `league/`: active league ingestion and standings jobs used by `nightlyRun.sh`
- `public/`: public match-data generation jobs used by `generatePublicMatchData.sh`
- `legacy/`: one-off historical league utilities
- `assets/`: asset download/build helpers

The root shell wrappers remain at the project root because server cron/PM2 jobs
may call those paths directly.
